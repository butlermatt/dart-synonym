Dart Synonyms is an AppEngine site that displays one language's code
examples and their Dart equivalents side by side (e.g. Javascript and equivalent
Dart).

Structure
=========

The site is a single HTML page (index.html).  It has external dependencies on
Bootstrap for structure and styling.  The JS file is compiled from the dart file
(assets/synonyms.dart).

Upon loading the single HTML page, the code comparison content is lazy loaded.
The comparison  content (XML files) is loaded via XMLHttpRequest
and is transformed into HTML using an XSLT script.

Maintenance
===========

The app is versioned in Git and hosted at Github:
