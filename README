Dart Rosetta Stone is an AppEngine site that displays one language's code examples and their Dart
equivalents side by side (e.g. Javascript and equivalent Dart).

Structure
=========

The site is a single HTML page (rosetta_stone.html).  It has external dependencies on a CSS file
(assets/rosetta_stone.css) and a JS file (assets/rosetta_stone.js).  The JS file is compiled
from the dart file (assets/rosetta_stone.dart).  It is compiled with the frog compiler.

Upon loading the single HTML page, the code comparison content is lazy loaded.  The comparison 
content (assets/rosetta_stone.json) is loaded via JSONp and is served from the same
AppEngine app.

Maintenance
===========

The code comparisons are kept in a spreadsheet:

Spreadsheet:
  https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnmjtuFxqXtydG5VaDFya0FXVFhCTVRZdVdtS2lwbUE&hl=en_US#gid=0

The code comparison JSON file is generated from the JSON API for Google Spreadsheets.  The link
below has the correct callback for JSONp.

Spreadsheet Json: 
  https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/0AnmjtuFxqXtydG5VaDFya0FXVFhCTVRZdVdtS2lwbUE/od6/public/basic?alt=json
  
This will work if you have curl:

curl -o rosetta_stone.json "https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/0AnmjtuFxqXtydG5VaDFya0FXVFhCTVRZdVdtS2lwbUE/od6/public/basic?alt=json"

The app is versioned in Git and hosted at Google Code:
